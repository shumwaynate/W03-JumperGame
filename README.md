# Seeker
This is a game like hangman, where you need to guess letters in a word that you only know the number of letters for. If you guess a letter wrong the jumper will slowly lose their parachute until it is too late.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 jumper 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
